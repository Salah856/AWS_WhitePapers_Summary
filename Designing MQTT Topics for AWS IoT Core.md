# Designing MQTT Topics for AWS IoT Core


- This whitepaper focuses on best practices for MQTT topic design in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Internet of Things (IoT). 

- It covers how developing an optimal MQTT topic schema can improve the overall architecture and efficiency of your IoT solutions. 

- It does so by providing greater visibility into cloud to device communication, 
- providing more fine-grained security permissions, and enhancing integration options with other AWS IoT Core services. 

- This whitepaper is intended for technical architects, IoT cloud engineers, and application architects. 


### MQTT communication patterns

- T applications support multiple communication scenarios, such as device-to-device, device-to-cloud, loud-to-device, and device-to-or-from-users. 

- Although the range of patterns can significantly vary, a ajority of MQTT communication models derive from three MQTT patterns: 
        
        --  point-to-point, broadcast, nd fan-in.
