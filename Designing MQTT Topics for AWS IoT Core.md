- This whitepaper focuses on best practices for MQTT topic design in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Internet of Things (IoT). 

- It covers how developing an optimal MQTT topic schema can improve the overall architecture and efficiency of your IoT solutions. 

- It does so by providing greater visibility into cloud to device communication, 
- providing more fine-grained security permissions, and enhancing integration options with other AWS IoT Core services. 

- This whitepaper is intended for technical architects, IoT cloud engineers, and application architects.
