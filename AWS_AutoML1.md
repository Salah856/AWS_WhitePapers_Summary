# Automating Machine Learning Model Development Using SageMaker Autopilot

AWS provides a variety of methods for automating the creation of ML models. I'll describe one such approach in this article: SageMaker Autopilot. A framework called Autopilot runs the essential phases of a typical ML workflow automatically. This basically automates the end-to-end ML process by allowing both inexperienced and seasoned ML practitioners to assign the manual chores of data discovery, algorithm selection, model training, and model optimization to a dedicated AWS service.
