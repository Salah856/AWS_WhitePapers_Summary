# Automating Machine Learning Model Development Using SageMaker Autopilot

AWS provides a variety of methods for automating the creation of ML models. I'll describe one such approach in this article: SageMaker Autopilot. A framework called Autopilot runs the essential phases of a typical ML workflow automatically. This basically automates the end-to-end ML process by allowing both inexperienced and seasoned ML practitioners to assign the manual chores of data discovery, algorithm selection, model training, and model optimization to a dedicated AWS service.

This post will introduce you to some of the AWS features that concentrate on machine learning (ML) solutions and ML automation.

The following topics will be covered: 
  • Introduction to the AWS AI and ML landscape 
  • Overview of SageMaker Autopilot 
  • Using SageMaker Autopilot to overcome automation problems 
  • Using the SageMaker SDK to automate the ML experiment


## Introducing the AWS AI and ML landscape

AWS offers a wide range of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to its clients. AWS has collected and arranged these capabilities into what is often known as the AI/ML Stack in order to further aid its clients in understanding them. The main objective of the AI/ML stack is to offer the tools that a developer or an expert in machine learning could need, depending on their level of experience. In essence, it equips all developers, whether they are regarded as novices or experts, with AI and ML skills.
